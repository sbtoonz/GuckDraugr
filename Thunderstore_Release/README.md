<summary> Travelers Notes:</summary>

# Attack #1
* This creature has a ranged attack that you must keep an eye for. If he rears his head back and raises his arms beware the retched spray from his foul mouth. This vile fluid soaked me and made me feel sick short term.

# Attack #2
* This creature when aggravated seems to explode... When I get too close to him he will shake violently and let out an awful myst which does make me quite sick for some time.

# Resources
* This creature seems to only drop the guck it has become infested with... I will keep this in mind so I do not have to find trees with this material.
